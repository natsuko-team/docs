## About Natsuko

Natsuko is a Discord moderation bot created during [Discord Hack Week](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33). 5 developers teamed up together to make the first version of the bot. We only had 5 days to do it, yet \[incomplete at the current point in time\].
